# Facenet: Real-time face recognition using deep learning Tensorflow 

This is completely based on a deep-learning neural network and implemented using the TensorFlow framework. Here you will learn how to implement fast and you can find code at GitHub uses is demonstrated at YouTube.

### Installation Python Libraries:

- Tensorflow (1.4.0)
- Scipy (0.17.0)
- Scikit-learn (0.19.1)
- Opencv (2.4.9.1)

For implementation and run this code follow [this BLOG link](http://www.aisangam.com/blog/real-time-face-recognition-using-facenet/). Implementation in the video is shown [HERE](https://youtu.be/dLrWDUPkpIg?list=PLCK5Mm9zwPkEhwu2OOw2CgO5ikoLdR36l).

### Usage:

Well, this facenet is defined and implemented in a facenet paper published in Arxiv (FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering). And also contains the idea of two papers named "A Discriminative Feature Learning Approach for Deep Face Recognition" and "Deep Face Recognition". For a deep understanding of its concept you can follow the upper paper. One also main part is that to generate your model you can follow [this link](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet) Face Recognition using TensorFlow. David Sandberg has nicely implemented you can also find it on GitHub for complete code and uses.
